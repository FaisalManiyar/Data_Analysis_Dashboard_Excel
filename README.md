# Interactive Excel Dashboard for Lead Analytics
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a clean and interactive Excel dashboard that tracks lead conversions and Forex interest.

## Question (KPIs)
- What is the flow of leads?
- How many leads are interested in Forex?
- What percentage of leads are not interested in Forex?
- How many leads have missing Forex interest data?
- What is the total number of leads processed?
- How many actual leads vs. duplicates?
- What is the conversion status of leads?

##  Data Processing Workflow
### Step 1: Data Verification
- Validated source integrity and column consistency
- Ensured all IDs are unique and traceable
### Step 2: Handling Missing Values
- Identified 226 blank entries in Forex interest
- Preserved blanks for segmentation analysis
- Flagged for future enrichment or outreach
### Step 3: Duplicate Removal
- Detected 37 duplicate entries using ID matching
- Removed from final lead count for accurate KPI tracking
### Step 4: Dashboard Design
- Used Excel PivotTables and Charts
- Applied slicers for Forex segmentation
- Created dynamic visuals for lead status and flow

## Project Insights
- Forex Interest Segmentation: Only 15 leads (≈5%) showed explicit interest in Forex, while 55 (≈19%) were not interested. A large majority (≈76%) had missing data, highlighting the need for better data capture.
- Lead Quality: Out of 296 total entries, 37 were duplicates, leaving 259 valid leads. This shows the importance of duplicate handling in maintaining dataset integrity.
- Conversion Status: Most leads remain “Cold” (43), with only 5 “Closed,” indicating low conversion efficiency and potential gaps in follow‑up strategy.
- Lead Flow Trends: Peak activity occurred on 12/28/2025 with 66 leads, suggesting campaign or seasonal spikes that can be leveraged for future outreach.
- Data Transparency: Missing values were flagged for enrichment, ensuring they remain part of analysis rather than being discarded.

## Use Cases
- Marketing campaign performance tracking
- Forex interest segmentation
- Lead quality and conversion analysis
- Sales outreach prioritization

## Final Conclusion 
The Meta Leads – Forex Interest Dashboard highlights that only a small fraction of leads show explicit interest in Forex, while most entries are either missing data or remain in a “Cold” status. Duplicate removal and data cleaning improved dataset integrity, but conversion rates remain low, signaling gaps in engagement and follow‑up strategies. The dashboard successfully transforms raw lead data into actionable insights, but it also reveals the need for stronger data capture and targeted outreach.
